cmd_t *cmd_new(char *argv[]);
// Allocates a new cmd_t with the given argv[] array. Makes string
// copies of each of the strings contained within argv[] using
// strdup() as they likely come from a source that will be
// altered. Ensures that cmd->argv[] is ended with NULL. Sets the name
// field to be the argv[0]. Sets finished to 0 (not finished yet). Set
// str_status to be "INIT" using snprintf(). Initializes the remaining
// fields to obvious default values such as -1s, and NULLs.

void cmd_free(cmd_t *cmd);
// Deallocates a cmd structure. Deallocates the strings in the argv[]
// array. Also deallocats the output buffer if it is not
// NULL. Finally, deallocates cmd itself.

void cmd_start(cmd_t *cmd);
// Forks a process and starts executes command in cmd in the process.
// Changes the str_status field to "RUN" using snprintf().  Creates a
// pipe for out_pipe to capture standard output.  In the parent
// process, ensures that the pid field is set to the child PID. In the
// child process, directs standard output to the pipe using the dup2()
// command. For both parent and child, ensures that unused file
// descriptors for the pipe are closed (write in the parent, read in
// the child).

void cmd_update_state(cmd_t *cmd, int block);
// If the finished flag is 1, does nothing. Otherwise, updates the
// state of cmd.  Uses waitpid() and the pid field of command to wait
// selectively for the given process. Passes block (one of DOBLOCK or
// NOBLOCK) to waitpid() to cause either non-blocking or blocking
// waits.  Uses the macro WIFEXITED to check the returned status for
// whether the command has exited. If so, sets the finished field to 1
// and sets the cmd->status field to the exit status of the cmd using
// the WEXITSTATUS macro. Calls cmd_fetch_output() to fill up the
// output buffer for later printing.
//
// When a command finishes (the first time), prints a status update
// message of the form
//
// @!!! ls[#17331]: EXIT(0)
//
// which includes the command name, PID, and exit status.

char *read_all(int fd, int *nread);
// Reads all input from the open file descriptor fd. Stores the
// results in a dynamically allocated buffer which may need to grow as
// more data is read.  Uses an efficient growth scheme such as
// doubling the size of the buffer when additional space is
// needed. Uses realloc() for resizing.  When no data is left in fd,
// sets the integer pointed to by nread to the number of bytes read
// and return a pointer to the allocated buffer. Ensures the return
// string is null-terminated. Does not call close() on the fd as this
// is done elsewhere.

void cmd_fetch_output(cmd_t *cmd);
// If cmd->finished is zero, prints an error message with the format
// 
// ls[12341] not finished yet
// 
// Otherwise retrieves output from the cmd->out_pipe and fills
// cmd->output setting cmd->output_size to number of bytes in
// output. Makes use of read_all() to efficiently capture
// output. Closes the pipe associated with the command after reading
// all input.

void cmd_print_output(cmd_t *cmd);
// Prints the output of the cmd contained in the output field if it is
// non-null. Prints the error message
// 
// ls[17251] : output not ready
//
// if output is NULL. The message includes the command name and PID.
